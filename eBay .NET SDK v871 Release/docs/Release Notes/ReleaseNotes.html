        <b>Notes:</b> The most recent full SDK release is this <b>eBay SDK for .NET Release</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Point releases, unlike full releases, do not go through the typical, full rounds
        of quality assurance. Point releases include bug fixes and updates to the wrapper
        classes. You can download this release and subsequent point releases from the <a
            href="http://developer.ebay.com/community/featured_projects/?name=eBay+SDK+for+.NET"
            target="_blank">eBay SDK for .NET download page</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Please see the most recent version of this Readme file, available at the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/developercenter/windows/"
            target="_blank">Windows Developer Center</a>.</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Please note that upgrades to an SDK should always be done in a test environment.
        Additionally, before using a version of the SDK, please read this Readme file. Please
        also read the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/XML/docs/WebHelp/ReleaseNotes.html"
            target="_blank">Trading API Release Notes</a> (which contain tables showing
        schema changes that occur every two weeks) for all Trading API versions released
        after your current version. The Trading API Release Notes are located at the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/developercenter/windows/"

        <b>Important:</b> Changes to the Trading API affect the SDK. For example, in schema
        version 499, deprecated objects in the schema were deleted, creating backward incompatibility.

    <h3>
        AddItem sample series illustrating usage of Seller Profile</h3>
    <p>
        The consoleAddItem, consoleAddFixedPriceItem samples have been modified to use Seller
        Profile to specify Payment, Shipping, and Return Policy Values. Seller profiles
        are created using the Business Policies Management API. Using this API sellers can
        create and manage multiple shipping, return, and payment policies and apply these
        policies to listings just by referencing the policy ID at listing time. Business
        Policies are currently available for testing in the Sandbox environment.</p>
    <h3>
        AttributesDemo sample modified to use only ItemSpecifics</h3>
    <p>
        eBay has been moving from the ID-based Attributes model to the Item Specifics model.
        All remaining categories that supported attributes will drop support for Id based
        attributes by May, 2012. The sample project has been accordingly modified to use
        only item specifics.

        SDK Version 747 for Full Release</h2>
    <p>
        This release is compatible with eBay's 747 Trading WSDL, and supports the following
        new features.</p>
    <h3>
        New LocalPickup Flag for GetMyEbayBuying and GetMyEbaySelling Calls</h3>
    <p>
        The LocalPickup flag indicates whether the buyer has selected local pickup as the
        shipping option or the seller has made local pickup available as a shipping option.</p>
    <h3>
        New SoldAsBin Flag in GetItem</h3>
    <p>
        New SoldAsBin flag in GetItem call indicates when an auction listing has ended before
        the stated auction end time due to a buyer using the Buy It Now option to purchase
        the item.</p>
    <h3>
        New Charity Refund Request Preference</h3>
    <p>
        New AutoOptDonationRefund flag in SetUserPreferences call allows a seller to request
        that eBay automatically request eBay Giving Works donation refunds after Unpaid
        Item cases are opened and closed through the Unpaid Item Assistant mechanism without
        payment. This preference is only applicable to charity listings.</p>
    <h3>
        Coming Soon: Motors Subtitle and Deposit Fields Replacing Attributes</h3>
    <p>
        eBay has added three new fields (SellerProvidedTitle, DepositAmount, and DepositType)
        to AddItem and related calls. These fields will soon replace the US and Canada eBay
        Motors Subtitle attribute (10246), and the US eBay Motors deposit amount and type
        attributes (10733 and 10734). The attributes will continue to work for a period
        of time to give developers time to migrate to the new fields. Keep an eye on these
        release notes for information about when the new fields will be functional.</p>
    <h3>
        Two New Member Message Types Added for Classified Ad Listings</h3>
    <p>
        ClassifiedsContactSeller and ClassifiedsBestOffer added as new message types. ClassifiedsContactSeller
        indicates that an inquiry has been sent to the seller regarding the corresponding
        classified ad listing. ClassifiedsBestOffer indicates that a best offer has been
        made on the seller's corresponding classified ad listing.</p>
    <h3>
        New Payment Status Value Added</h3>
    <p>
        A new value of "Paid" can now be returned in GetOrders (and other order retrieval
        calls) when checkout is complete and order has been paid for by the buyer. This
        value is returned in the CheckoutStatus.eBayPaymentStatus field. This value may
        also be returned in the MyeBaySelling and MyeBayBuying calls.</p>
    <h3>
        New Dispute Explanation Added</h3>
    <p>
        A new dispute explanation was added and available to use through the AddDispute
        call. The value is "SellerRanOutOfStock", and this value can be used by the seller
        when cancelling an order due to an item being out of stock.</p>
    <h3>
        GetOrders Now Retrieves Seller's Item and Shipping Discounts</h3>

                        This release no longer supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 and .NET 1.1. Now the

                    systems. The installer will determine whether you have Microsoft's .NET Framework

                            Key Features of This Release</h3>
                        <p>
                            With this release, we provide full support for Microsoft's .NET 2.0 platform (.NET
                            SDK). This version of eBay's SDK for .NET also still supports .NET 1.1.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Build Information:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The eBay SDK for .NET is built in VS2003/.NET 1.1,</li>
                                <li>The provided .dlls can be used in both VS2003/.NET 1.1 and VS2005/.NET 2.0 environment.</li>
                                <li>You may also choose to build the whole SDK from source in VS2005/.NET 2.0. If you
                                    choose to build from the source, you should use the proxy generator for VS2005/.NET
                                    2.0 to regenerate the eBay Trading Web Service proxy before you build.</li>
                                <li>A NANT build script is provided in this release for advanced users who prefer building
                                    from the command line instead of building with Microsoft Visual Studio. This script
                                    only works with .NET 1.1 at this time.</li>
                            </ul>

                            As of this release, you can now use eBay's SDK for .NET with Microsoft's Vista operating
                            system, provided that you:
                            <ul>
                                <li>are using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 with Service Pack 1 installed</li>
                                <li>only use our zipped package (not our installation package) to install eBay's SDK
                                    for .NET on Vista</li>

                                    VS 2008. The .dll files in this release can be used in Vista/VS2005 directly. You
                                    do not need to convert them to VS 2005 format.</li>

                        <h3>
                            UploadSiteHostedPicture</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since the classes in the eBay Picture Service (EPS) have been replaced by the <b
                                class="con">UploadSiteHostedPictures</b> Trading API (XML) call, the DotNET
                            SDK now supports the <b class="con">UploadSiteHostedPictures</b> call. Because this
                            is a Trading API call, you will need to provide an <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/quickstartguide/Default.aspx">
                                eBay developer authorization token</a> (that you obtain with your application
                            keys) when making this call.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <b class="con">UploadSiteHostedPictures</b> call is the only call in the Trading
                            API that doesn't support SOAP. Therefore, you need to use the following (XML) endpoints
                            (Gateway URLs):
                            <ul>
                                <li>For the Sandbox, use: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/ws/api.dll</li>
                                <li>For Production, use: https://api.ebay.com/ws/api.dll</li>
                            </ul>
                            In addition, it is important that you use these endpoints for both the production
                            and sandbox environments. The addresses for both environments must be consistent
                            because you will need to update the authorization token in your ApiContext class
                            before switching from one platform to the other (Trading API (XML) and SDK servers
                            use different authorization keys.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can still use the EPS libraries with this release, but they will eventually
                            be discontinued, so we recommend that you migrate to the newer call as soon as you
                            can. The <b class="con">UploadSiteHostedPictures</b> call enables you to upload
                            files in image formats such as JPG by including a binary attachment after the XML
                            input, as part of the request. The call returns <b class="con">SiteHostedPictureDetails.FullURL</b>,
                            which must be stored by your application (for associating the picture using the
                            <b class="con">Item.PictureDetails.PictureURL</b> field of <b class="con">AddItem</b>,
                            <b class="con">ReviseItem</b>, or <b class="con">RelistItem</b>).

                            An updated ASP attributeDemo sample includes return policy information that is integrated
                            with the rest of the Item details, instead of being posted on a separate page. It
                            also includes a dynamic lookup feature for Shipping Service, Payment Methods, Listing
                            Type, and Listing Duration. This sample demonstrates the usage of eBay Custom Item
                            Specifics with the Trading API GetCategoryFeatures and GetCategorySpecifics calls.</p>
                        <p>
                            Please note that for Return Policy and for the requirement to specify shipping,
                            some samples contain hard-coded fields. Therefore, if you want to change the target
                            site used in the sample, you must integrate <code>GetCategoryFeaturesCall</code>
                            and <code>GeteBayDetailsCall</code> into the sample. For important information,

                        <p>
                            The Attributes Library in the SDK now supports downloading and rendering sitewide
                            characteristic sets. This enables you to include sitewide attributes in listings.</p>
                        <p>
                            On many sites, you use sitewide attribute sets to fill in an item's Return Policy
                            fields, the Item Condition field, or both. Some categories may support zero, one,
                            or both of these sets (as indicated in each sitewide set's "exclude list").</p>
                        <p>
                            The changes described here assume you are already familiar with the Attributes Library.

                            Also, in the <b>AttributesMaster</b> class, the <b>RenderHtml()</b> method has been
                            overloaded to support rendering Return Policy fields (using eBay's XSL stylesheet).
                            This method checks whether the data is for a return policy, and adds the <b>pageId</b>
                            attribute to the <b>SelectedAttributes</b> node if it is.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Note</b>: In a few cases, the Item Condition attribute may appear twice when
                            you render standard and sitewide data for a category (please <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/community/forums"
                                target="_blank">inform eBay</a> if this occurs). This occurs when a category
                            is mapped to a standard characteristic set that defines an Item Condition attribute
                            locally, and the category is also mapped to a sitewide Item Condition characteristic
                            set. To avoid unexpected results, the seller should either use the local Item Condition
                            defined in the standard set, or you should make sure the same value is used for
                            both when you list the item.</p>

                        <p>
                            The Attributes Library now gives you the option to store attribute metadata locally,
                            and only download updates for a site if a newer version exists on the site. Each
                            provider includes one or more <b>Get</b> methods for this purpose. In the downloader
                            classes that implement these provider interfaces, these methods check to see what
                            version of the metadata is already stored locally and compare it to the version
                            on the site. If the version on the site is different, or if the metadata isn't stored
                            locally, these <b>Get</b> methods download the appropriate metadata from the site
                            and store it in the local file system.</p>
                        <p>
                            These are the filename conventions (where <i>version</i> is the metadata version,
                            not the request version):</p>

                        <p>
                            For example, if you retrieve a full attribute metadata XML file from the UK site
                            (without specifying a particular CSId), and the attribute system version is 8005,
                            the filename would be: UK.ALL.8005.attrcs.</p>
                        <p>
                            If you retrieve attribute metadata for one or more CSIds, the downloader creates
                            a hashcode for the set (the sum of the IDs), and uses that value in the filename.</p>
                        <p>
                            The downloader saves these files in the C:\temp directory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Important:</b> You can delete these locally stored files, but if you edit or
                            rename them, your application may fail.</p>
                        <p>
                            Alternatively, each provider includes <b>Download</b> methods to enable you to force
                            a full download of the metadata without checking the version. In the downloader
                            classes, these methods store the metadata in memory only.</p>

                                    You can use the new ExceptionFilter class to specify several types of logging. You
                                    can specify logging in cases of specific API errors and HTTP status codes. You also
                                    can specify logging in general cases of API exceptions and HTTP exceptions. The
                                    new logging feature makes logging more useful and reduces the size of your logs.

                                    The eBay SDK for .NET no longer includes the database sample. In past releases,
                                    the database sample was installed at the following location: C:\Program Files\eBay\SDKInstallDir\Samples\C#\DatabaseSample.
                                    Additionally, references in other samples to the database sample have been removed.
                                    However, the compiled version of the database sample, eBay.Service.SDK.Integration.dll,
                                    is available in the following location: C:\Program Files\eBay\SDKInstallDir\eBay.Service.SDK.Integration.dll.
                                    In pre-459 releases, the database sample files were referred to as the "integration
                                    library." Please note that if you regenerate eBay.snk and then rebuild ebay.Service.dll,
                                    errors can occur if you compile and run a sample that depends on the database sample.

                                <p>
                                    A multi-call test program demonstrates a scenario that uses 8 different API calls
                                    involving data of a single item listing. To run the multi-call test program, use
                                    the following solution file: C:\Program Files\eBay\SDKInstallDir\Source\SanityTest\testscenarios\SanityTestScenarios.sln.</p>

                                <p>
                                    You can use updates to the CallRetry and ApiException classes to detect HTTP errors
                                    and subsequently perform call retry. Specifically, you can implement call retry
                                    in response to 502 HTTP errors, 404 HTTP errors, and related HTTP errors from a
                                    web server. In the SoapApiDemo sample, at C:\Program Files\eBay\SDKInstallDir\Samples\C#\SoapApiDemo,
                                    updates to FrmGetItem.cs, including a GetCallRetry method, show one way to use the
                                    new functionality of the CallRetry class.</p>

                                    The StoresFixedPrice tag, currently available for international sites, will soon
                                    be obsolete. The 471 API schema released in late July contained additions to ItemTypeFilterCodeType
                                    that apply to searches with GetSearchResults and GetCategoryListings. The additions
                                    to ItemTypeFilterCodeType must be used instead of the StoresFixedPrice tag. For
                                    more information, please see the Trading API Release Notes (which contain tables
                                    showing schema changes that occur every two weeks) at the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/support/docs/"

                                <p>
                                    The following wrapper classes now store images in a PictureDetails container, by
                                    default: AddItemCall, VerifyAddItemCall, RelistItemCall, and AddLiveAuctionItemCall.
                                    Formerly, a SiteHostedPicture container was used. If you want your application to
                                    continue using a SiteHostedPicture container, set the UseDeprecatedPictureStructure
                                    property of the wrapper class to true. Note that SiteHostedPicture is deprecated.
                                    Applications eventually will have to use PictureDetails because with API version
                                    439 and higher, PictureDetails is used for pictures associated with an item.</p>

                                    The name of the integration library has been changed to "Database Sample." The name

                                    of the <i>eBay.Service.SDK.Integration</i> folder has been changed to <i>DatabaseSample</i>.
                                    The sample is meant solely to show one way to store and access eBay data.</p>
