<h2>Readme for Building the eBay SDK for .NET</h2>

<p>To build the SDK, please use the sections below, in the order they are presented.</p>

<p>References to &quot;SDKInstallDir&quot; and to &quot;SDK Installation Directory&quot;
refer to the top-level SDK directory (for example, C:\Program Files\eBay\eBay .NET SDK v615 Full Release).</p>

<p>Building the SDK initially requires that you: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Install Microsoft Visual Studio(VS2005 or VS2008) on your computer
	<li>Delete any bin and obj folders that were created with previous versions of Microsoft Visual Studio
</ul>

<h3>Generate a Strong Name Key</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Confirm that your Path variable includes the folder of the Microsoft .NET Framework Strong Name Utility
		(e.g., C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\Bin).</li>
	<br><br>
	<li>Run the following BAT file: <br>SDKInstallDir\Source\GenSNKey.bat<br><br>
	This will generate a Strong Name key to sign the generated components. If you prefer not to use GenSNKey.bat, then in a Command window, at \SDKInstallDir\Source, run the following command: <br>
	<code>sn -k eBay.snk</code>. </li><br><br>
</ol>


<h3>Use a WSDL to Generate Code Stubs</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Follow the code generation instructions in the Readme file in the following folder: SDKInstallDir\Tools.</li>
	<br><br>
	<li>Confirm that code stubs were generated at SDKInstallDir\Source\eBay.Service.SDK\Core\Soap\WebService.cs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Corresponding NAnt command: <b>nant GenProxy</b>


<h3>Use the Solution File to Build the SDK</h3>
<p>Note: These instructions assume you are creating a Release build. If you are creating a Debug build, please
substitute "Debug" for "Release."</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use Microsoft Visual Studio to open DOTNET.SOAP.sln (located at SDKInstallDir\Source\DOTNET.SOAP.sln).
	If prompted, use the Visual Studio Conversion Wizard to update the solution and create backup files.</li>
<br>
<br>
	<li>Build the eBay.Service project.</li>
<br>
<br>
	<li>Confirm that the eBay.Service.dll file was generated in SDKInstallDir\Source\eBay.Service.SDK\bin\Release.</li>
<br>
<br>
	<li>Confirm that the <i>eBay.Service</i> reference in the eBay.Service.SDK.Attribute and
	Helper projects is correct. It should point
	to SDKInstallDir\Source\eBay.Service.SDK\bin\Release\eBay.Service.dll.<br><br>
	If the Reference is incorrect, update it to
	point to SDKInstallDir\Source\eBay.Service.SDK\bin\Release\eBay.Service.dll.</li>
<br>
<br>
	<li>Build the whole DOTNET.SOAP solution.<br>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Corresponding NAnt command: <b>nant BuildSourceInRelease</b>


<h3>Copy the Built Files to the SDK Installation Directory</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>In the SDKInstallDir\Source folder, run CopyRelease.bat.<br><br>
		<li>Use date stamps to confirm that the
		recently-built files were copied to the SDK installation directory.</li><br>
	</ol>
<p>Corresponding NAnt command: <b>nant CopyLibraryInRelease</b>
<p>Note: SDK samples (located at SDKInstallDir\Samples) reference
		the built files in the SDK installation directory.</p>
