		/// <b>Half.com only.</b>&nbsp;Retrieves a summary of pending or paid payments that Half.com created for the
		/// seller identified by the authentication token in the request. Only retrieves
		/// payments that occurred within a particular pay period. Each payment is for one
		/// order line item in one order. An order can contain order line items for
		/// multiple items from multiple sellers, but this call only retrieves payments that
		/// are relevant to one seller. The financial value of a payment is typically based on
		/// an amount that a buyer paid to Half.com for an order line item, with adjustments for
		/// shipping costs and Half.com's commission. For most sellers, each month contains
		/// two pay periods: One from the 1st to the 15th of the month, and one from the 16th
		/// to the last day of the month. Sellers can refer to their account information on
		/// the Half.com site to determine their pay periods. (You cannot retrieve a seller's
		/// pay periods by using eBay API.) When a buyer makes a purchase and an
		/// order is created, Half.com creates a payment for the seller and marks it as
		/// Pending in the seller's Half.com account. Within a certain number of days after
		/// the pay period ends, Half.com settles payments for that period and marks each
		/// completed payment as Paid. See the Half.com Web site online help for more
		/// information about how payments are managed.

		/// <param name="PaymentStatus">
		/// Filter to retrieve only items with the specified payment status (Paid or
		/// Pending). "Pending payments" are payments that Half.com has created but
		/// that have not yet been sent to the seller's financial institution. Pending
		/// payments are typically available once a buyer pays for an order. As
		/// Half.com processes payments by using periodic batch jobs, the
		/// GetSellerPayments response might not include an order line item's payment for
		/// up to 20 minutes after the buyer has paid. You can retrieve pending
		/// payments for the current pay period. Pending payments that have not been
		/// settled yet can also be retrieved for previous pay periods. "Paid
		/// payments" are payments that Half.com processed during previous pay
		/// periods. Paid payments might not appear in the seller's financial
		/// institution account balance until a certain number of days after the
		/// current pay period ends (see the Half.com online help for details). You
		/// can only retrieve paid payments for one previous pay period at a time.

		///
		/// <param name="PaymentTimeFrom">
		/// Time range filter that retrieves Half.com payments that were created within
		/// a single pay period. Sellers can refer to the Half.com site to determine
		/// their pay periods. PaymentTimeFrom is the earliest (oldest) time and
		/// PaymentTimeTo is the latest (most recent) time in the range. Half.com pay
		/// periods start and end at midnight Pacific time, but the time values are
		/// stored in the database in GMT (not Pacific time). See "Time Values" in the
		/// eBay Features Guide for information about converting between GMT and
		/// Pacific time. 
		/// 
		/// If you specify a PaymentStatus of Pending, add a buffer of one hour (or one
		/// day) to both ends of the time range to retrieve more data than you need, and
		/// then filter the results on the client side as needed. If any pending
		/// payments match the request, the response may include all payments since the
		/// beginning of the period. 
		/// 
		/// If you specify a PaymentStatus of Paid, the time range must contain one
		/// full pay period. That is, PaymentTimeFrom must be earlier or equal the
		/// start time of the pay period, and PaymentTimeTo must be later than or
		/// equal to the end time of the pay period. Otherwise, no paid payments are
		/// returned. For example, if the pay period starts on 2005-09-16 and ends on
		/// 2005-09-30, you could specify an earlier PaymentTimeFrom value of
		/// 2005-09-16T00:00:00.000Z and a later PaymentTimeTo value of
		/// 2005-10-01T12:00:00.000Z.
